# phonebook
A simple implementation for a text-file based phonebook system using C programming language. 
The program loads a previously stored records file of a phone book and operates on it (search, add, delete, sort, modify a contact, save changes).
It was a team final project for Programming 1 course.
The objective of the project was to ensure the complete understanding of the basics of programming and dealing with C programming language.
